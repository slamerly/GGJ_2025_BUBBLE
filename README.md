**Squeaky Clean** was our team's entry for Global Game Jam 2025, built on **Unreal Engine** around the theme of **Bubbles**. 

The game tasks players with satisfying machines by delivering specific objects before their timers expire. 
Delivering the wrong object reduces satisfaction time, and players must also watch out for large plastic ducks â€“ easy targets!
